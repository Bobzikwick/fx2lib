Before building this library, you need sdcc installed and in your path.

 http://sdcc.sf.net

To build this library, run make in the lib folder.

> cd lib
> make

You get lib/fx2.lib

To use routines included with this library in your own firmware, 
add the include files to your include path and the lib file to your compile command:

> sdcc -mmcs51 -I<path to includes> <your c file> fx2.lib -L <path to fx2.lib dir> 

Enjoy!
Comments, Patches, all welcome.
