You can move up the food chain of programming languages pretty quickly if you like:

      C:    Program Your Firmware
    C++:    Write a libusb driver
 Python:    Write Bindings for your driver so you can test things interactively!

fx2:
 An example firmware loader and basic firmware terminal using the above strategy.
 Requires libusb-1.0, Python 2.5
 use fx2load.py w/ reset_bix function to load firmware onto a device.

lights:
 A really simple program that cycles the lights on the CY3864 development board.
