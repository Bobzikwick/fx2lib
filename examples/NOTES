You can move up the food chain of programming languages pretty quickly if you like:

      C:    Program Your Firmware
    C++:    Write a libusb driver
 Python:    Write Bindings for your driver so you can test things interactively!

fx2:
 An example firmware loader and basic firmware terminal using the above strategy.
 Requires libusb-1.0, Python 2.5
 use fx2load.py w/ reset_bix function to load firmware onto a device.

 Example:
  python
  > from fx2load import *
  > openfx2()
  > reset_bix('<path to bix file>')
  > f.do_usb_command (.....
  > f.ep_bulk(......
 
 At this point, the source is the documentation!

lights:
 A really simple program that cycles the lights on the CY3864 development board.

bulkloop:
 Demonstrations:
  * looping data on endpoints.
  * Custom device descriptor.
  * Vendor commands.
  * Usb jump table.
  * serial IO

i2c:
 A port of the Cypress i2c example.

reset:
 Shows writing to the eeprom on the dev board.  The included iic data is the default data
 on the dev board and you can use this program to reset your board back to the default 
 state if you happen to write a non-working iic file to the device.  You shouldn't 
 probably use this on a real board unless you really know what you're doing :)


serial:
 A simple terminal echo firmware.  Echos whatever you type back to the serial terminal.
